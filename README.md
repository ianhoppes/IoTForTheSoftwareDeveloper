# IoT for the Software Developer Prese
This repo contains the demo code and slides for my "IoT for the Software Developer" talk.

[Raleigh Code Camp 2016](http://codecamp.org/s/2016/8214) - October 29, 2016

## Abstract
You've probably heard the buzz surrounding the Internet of Things (IoT). Want to learn more but don't know where to start as a software developer? Things couldn't be easier today - no circuit design or soldering experience required! We'll cover some basic electronics, discuss the components of an IoT solution, and put together a demonstration using Windows 10 IoT Core on Raspberry Pi, SeeedStudio Grove sensors, and Azure IoT Suite.
